Data Structures Module Exam

Your goal in this assignment is to simulate a whole bunch of lasers of different colors and have them fly across the screen.
Each of the steps below are in the order of the commented sections main.js

1. Canvas Setup
    Setup your canvas to have a width of 1200 and a height of 700

2. Global Vars
    Create a variable to store your image element. The id of the image is 'spacebg'
    Create 100 lasers beams using parallel arrays, a 2D array, or an array of laser objects.
        - Each one starts on the left side of the screen.
        - Each one is randomly positioned along the height of the canvas.
        - The height of each laser is 5 and never changes.
        - The width of each laser is a random value between 50 and 200.
        - The speed of each laser is a random value between 10 and 30.
        - The color of each laser is random (see below for details)

3. Event Listeners
    Create an event listener such that when the mouse is moving over the canvas (mousemove event), a function called 'mouseEventHandler' is run.
    Create a keypress event listener.

4. Canvas Drawing
    Create your canvas drawing function. 
    It should load the spacebg image that matches the canvas height and width.
    It loops through the lasers array, properly animating the beams.
    Once a beam is fully off the right side of the canvas, have it reappear from fully off the left side of the canvas.
    New beams should have a new random height and a new random color and a new random width.

5. getRandomColor
    Follow the algorithm provided in main.js to get the random color working.
    Use this function to randomly choose colors for your lasers.
    If you cannot get this working, make all your lasers red.

6. mouseEventHandler
    This function reads the Y coordinate of the mouse and
    Causes all lasers Y-values to match the mouse's Y value
    Refer to Mouse & Keyboard Input on the site if you forgot how to read mouse coordinates
    Use a 'mousemove' event in your event listener

7. keypressHandler
    When the 'q' key is pressed, all the lasers speeds increase by 1.
    When the 'z' key is pressed, all the lasers speeds decrease by 1.

8. myBonusFunction
    For bonus marks, create your own function that does something neat with the lasers!
